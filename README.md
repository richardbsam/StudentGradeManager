# Student Grade Management System

## Overview
This project is a simple **console-based application** developed in C++ that allows teachers to manage students’ grades.  
The goal is to simulate a real-world use case where teachers can efficiently record and track students’ performance.  

The application allows the user to:
- Add students with their names and ID numbers.
- Record grades for different subjects.
- Calculate and display each student’s average grade.
- Determine pass/fail status based on a cutoff mark.
- Save and load data from a file so information persists across sessions.  

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of C++ fundamentals such as:
- File input/output (I/O)
- Classes and objects
- Vectors and arrays
- Loops and conditional logic
- Data persistence

## Development Environment
The software was developed using:
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** as the code editor  
- **g++ (MinGW-w64)** as the C++ compiler  
- **gdb** for debugging  

**Programming Language:**  
- C++ (Standard Library only, no external frameworks)

## Useful Websites
These resources were helpful during development:  

- [cplusplus.com](https://cplusplus.com/) – Reference for C++ standard library and syntax.  
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) – Troubleshooting errors and learning best practices.  
- [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) – Guides on C++ concepts and code examples.  
- [Visual Studio Code Docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs) – Setup and configuration of VS Code for C++ development.

## Future Work
Some improvements and features I plan to add in the future:  
- Implement editing and deleting student records.  
- Add more detailed reporting (highest/lowest grade, subject-wise performance).  
- Create a menu-driven interface for easier navigation.  
- Extend functionality to handle multiple classes/teachers.
